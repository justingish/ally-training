# Detailed Accessibility Training Outline (45 minutes)

## 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

- [Worst Volume Control Ever](https://uxdesign.cc/the-worst-volume-control-ui-in-the-world-60713dc86950)
- **Why accessibility matters**
  - Make Digital Transformation Accessible to Everyone
    - Types of disabilities to design for: visual, auditory, motor, cognitive
  - **Statistics**: 1 in 4 adults in the US have a disability
  - Legal requirements: ADA, Section 508, WCAG, EAA (European Accessibility Act)
  - Ethical considerations (digital inclusion)
- [**WCAG Principles**](https://www.wcag.com/resource/what-is-wcag/): Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
- [**WCAG Standards**](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22)

## 2. Semantic HTML as Foundation (8 minutes)

- **Native HTML elements vs. DIV soup**
  - HTML describes the data, not the presentation
  - Links vs Buttons
  - Demo: Comparing `<div onclick>` to `<button>`
    - No keyboard support
    - No screen reader support
    - No built-in states (focus, hover, active, disabled)
    - Can't disable a div
    - In order to make a div accessible, you have to add a lot of extra code
  - Accessibility tree demonstration
- **Document structure importance**
  - Proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
  - Landmark regions (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
  - Some useful native HTML elements that are often overlooked:
    - `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`
    - `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images
    - `<time>` for dates and times
  - How screen readers navigate using these structures

## 3. ARIA and Accessible Names (8 minutes)

- **First rule of ARIA**: Don't use ARIA when HTML can do the job
- ARIA is essentially CSS but for assistive technologies
- ARIA doesn't add behavior, it only adds semantics
- [Five Rules of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria):
  1. Use Native HTML elements first
  2. Don't change semantics of native elements
  3. All ARIA controls must be keyboard operable
  4. Don't hide a focusable element with ARIA
  5. All interactive elements must have an accessible name
- HTML hidden vs `aria-hidden` vs CSS `display: none` vs `.visually-hidden`
  - [Table](https://practical-accessibility.today/code/hiding-techniques/)
  - HTML `hidden` attribute hides elements from both screen readers and visually
  - CSS `display: none` hides elements from both screen readers and visually
  - `aria-hidden` hides elements from screen readers but not visually
  - `.visually-hidden` makes elements invisible but still accessible to screen readers
- Where do elements get their accessible names from?
  - HTML content, value, alt, or title attributes
  - `<label>` elements for form controls
  - `<legend>` for fieldsets
  - `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
  - `aria-label` doesn't translate well by automated tools
  - `title` attribute (not recommended)

## 4. Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management (10 minutes)

- **The Tab order** and why it matters
  - Natural DOM order vs. tabindex
  - Dangers of positive tabindex values
- **Focus indicators**
  - Never remove `:focus` without alternative
  - Focus styles that work in all modes
- **Focus management for SPAs**
  - Moving focus after route changes
  - Restoring focus after actions
- **Quick exercise**: Find tab order issues in one of your apps

## 5. Common Components & Patterns (10 minutes)

- **Form accessibility**
  - Labels and error messages
  - Input validation and error states
  - Form controls and custom components
- **Images and media**
  - Alt text best practices
  - Audio/video controls and captions
- **Color and contrast**
  - WCAG contrast requirements
  - Not relying on color alone
  - Supporting dark mode and forced-colors mode

## 6. Testing & Tools (4 minutes)

- **Browser tools**
  - DevTools accessibility panel
  - Lighthouse/axe
- **Screen reader basics**
  - VoiceOver quick demo (since you're on macOS)
  - Key commands for testing
- **Integrating into workflow**
  - Automated testing recommendations
  - Tools that work with your codebase
